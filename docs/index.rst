About OiRA
==========

OiRA (Online interactive Risk Assessment) is a comprehensive, easy to use and cost-free web application.

It helps micro and small organisations to put in place a thorough step-by-step risk assessment process – from the identification and evaluation of workplace risks, through decision making on preventive actions and the completion of these actions, to continued monitoring and reporting.
