OiRA tools generator Manual
***************************

=======
General
=======

This manual as about the ‘admin’ website (CMS) of the OiRA risk assessment
platform, i.e. where developers create risk assessment tools that will be
displayed on the ‘client’ website of the OiRA risk assessment platform,
where end users (enterprises) access OiRA tools to perform a risk assessment.

--------
Browsers
--------

Preferred web browsers to access OiRA (both admin and client) are:

* Google Chrome version 70 or later
* Safari version 12 or later
* Mozilla Firefox version 60 or later
* Microsoft Edge
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 11

    .. note::

      All versions of Internet Explorer lower than 11 are not supported!


-----------------------
Types of Login Accounts
-----------------------

There are two types of Login Accounts in OiRA:

    * The country manager account: this account has to be created by EU-OSHA
      and will allow the country manager to create sector(s) in their own country

    * A sectoral account: for countries/organisations for which the country
      manager does not apply, EU-OSHA will create a sectoral account

In both cases, EU-OSHA needs to create the account first, if it is not already present because it is used for other OSHA sites such as the OiRA community site or the OSHWiki. Once your account has been created you will receive an email, at the provided address, containing the login information. Please note: Both your user name and password are case sensitive!

Country managers can create sectors by clicking the tab “User management” and then *Add new sector*

    *A country manager can create sector*


In order to promote a user to a sector manager, the country manager needs to enter this sector, and then use the “LDAP“ tab. There, the country manager can search for the target user and use the *Grant roles* button.
For any current user who has the Sector Manager role, the *Revoke roles* button can be used to remove this role again.

After logging out successfully, you will be brought back to the login
screen where you will see the notification 'You have been logged out'.


==========================
Setting up a new OiRA tool
==========================

A new OiRA tool is created in two steps. First, you define the basic information such as the name of the tool and which kind of evaluation method should be used. These settings will stay fixed and cannot be changed later. In the second step, you provide more details about the tool, such as introductory text, information about its language and further options. You will be able to modify those settings at any time.

.. _create-oira-tool:

----------------------
Adding a new OiRA tool
----------------------

On the overview page of a sector, either click the link “add a new OiRA tool” at the bottom of the screen, or use the *Actions* menu at the top right to “Add new -> OiRA tool”.

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_add_oira_tool.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Adding a new OiRA tool

    *Adding a new OiRA tool*


You will then be brought to the form below:

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_5_addsurvey.png
    :align: center
    :alt: The “new OiRA tool” form

    *The “new OiRA tool” form*

When creating a new OiRA tool you can choose from the following three options:

#. **Create a new OiRA tool from scratch**
    This option is recommended when you already have an existing risk-assessment tool and would like to transfer this to OiRA.

#. **Base my OiRA tool on an existing OiRA tool of my organisation**
    This option is recommended when you are planning to revise the contents of your OiRA tool.

    .. note::

        When dealing with minor amendments, e.g. typos, it would be best to
        implement these in the existing OiRA tool and simply republish it.

#. **Base my OiRA tool on an existing OiRA tool of another organisation**
    You can decide which existing OiRA tool is most suitable for your sector. You can copy and modify it, and thus avoid having to create one from scratch. You have to determine the amendments for your own sector. For example, the butcher could copy and modify the OiRA tool of the fish retailer.

    There is an alternative option for benefiting from already available content, which is explained in the :ref:`chapter about the Library <library>`.

    .. note ::

        After you've copied an existing OiRA tool, any changes made to the 'source' OiRA tool will not automatically be reflected in your own OiRA tool. When, for example, the butcher has copied the OiRA tool of the fish retailer and the fish retailer implements changes in their OiRA tool afterwards, these changes will not appear in the OiRA tool of the butcher.

    If you would like to copy the OiRA tool of another sector as a starting point, you need to first select the country in the drop-down menu and subsequently the sector of your choice.

    If this sector provides more than one version, you will see all versions listed, so that you can chose the appropriate one.

Give the OiRA tool a name (title). This name will be shown to the end-user in the overview. Example: Hairdressers Risk Assessment Tool 2010.

  .. note ::

     It is not possible to change this name later on, since it will be used to create the URL for this tool in the client. In case a change of the tool's name (title) is necessary, please contact EU-OSHA for assistance.

Then click on “Create” at the bottom of the page. Please note that setting up a new OiRA tool can take a while if you've chosen to copy from an existing OiRA tool.

In case of a new OiRA tool you will see a screen as shown below. Your new tool appears in the navigation in the left column and also in the list of tools and versions from your sector in the right column. The first version, called “Standard”, has automatically been created. More details about versions are explained :ref:`in the chapter on OiRA tool versions <oira-tool-versions>`.

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_6_newsurvey.png

.. _edit-oira-tool:

-----------------------------------
Editing the details of an OiRA tool
-----------------------------------

When on the context of an OiRA tool version, click the **Edit** button or hyperlink, to open the edit form.

    .. figure:: images/editor/editor_edit_link.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The location of the edit button and link

      *The location of the edit button and link*

You will then see a form similar to the one shown below.

    .. figure:: images/editor/editor_7_survey_version_edit.png
      :align: center
      :alt: An OiRA tool version edit form

      *An OiRA tool version edit form*


The form contains a number of different fields: texts that will be shown to the end-user, metadata and a number of settings that allow specific modifications to how the OiRA tool behaves.

Text fields and metadata
------------------------


* **Version name**:
    You can modify the version name of the OiRA tool. The name you enter here
    will not be visible to the end-user and is mainly intended to
    help you manage the different versions. When you create a new OiRA tool,
    its first version is automatically created and given the name *Standard*.

* **Summary**:
    A short description of the contents of the OiRA tool. This text will be displayed to then end user.

* **Introduction text**:
    Please provide some relevant and encouraging information for end-users of the OiRA tool. For example:

    - The importance of risk assessment
    - The fact that risk assessment is not necessarily something complicated (to demystify risk assessment)
    - **The fact that the tool has especially been conceived to meet the needs of the sector's enterprises**.
        We recommend to specify here which end-users are expected to use the tool
        (*i.e. who is the end-user of the tool?*).

    **Please adapt this text according to your sector needs**, but try to keep it short.

    You may add hyperlinks to pages and files; for example a file containing an employee questionnaire
    which social partners in your sector have decided to be important.

    If you do not edit the Introduction field, the default text will be displayed once the tool is published.


* **Language**:
    Choose the language of your OiRA tool from the drop-down menu. **This action is mandatory**
    in order to ensure that the appropriate language of the OiRA interface is selected.

* **Classification Code (optional)**:
    Write the NACE-code of your sector.


.. _enable-measures-in-place:

Fields that allow special behaviour
-----------------------------------

* **Type of OiRA Tool**
    This setting determines how an OiRA tool is presented to the user.

    * The **Classic** type will show the risk statement, the Yes / No question, plus the evaluation, where applicable. If the user answers with “No” or if the risk is a priority risk, then the risk will appear in the Action Plan, so that measures to mitigate it *in the future* be defined.

    * An OiRA tool with **Measures already in place** takes different approach: Under the risk statement, the user can state which measures to mitigate the risk are *already in place now*. All “common solutions” provided by the tool creator can be selected, but the user can also describe their own solutions. The Yes / No question follows the list of those measures and asks the user if the already implemented measures are sufficient to take care of the risk, or if further measures need to be planned *for the future*. If the answer is “No, not sufficient”, then risk appears in the Action Plan. That means, this is the same behaviour as for the “classic” type).

    While the type of tool can be changed at any time, it is important to be aware of the effects this has. Special care needs to be taken that the risk statements match the type of the tool.

    **If you are unsure what option to take, chose the “Classic” version.**

    For more details on this alternative tool type, see the chapter :ref:`OiRA tool with measures already in place <measures-in-place>`.


.. _custom-notification:

* **Show a custom notification for this OiRA tool?**
    With this setting, you can define that all end-users of this OiRA tool will see a notification message with custom text when they use the tool.

    If you tick the checkbox, you will see two more fields:


    .. figure:: images/editor/custom_message_cms.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Enter title and text for a custom notification

      *Enter title and text for a custom notification*

    * **Tool notification title**
        Enter the headline for the notification.

    * **Tool notification message**
        Enter the text that should be shown. You can use the usual formatting in the message, e.g. paragraphs, lists and bold text. You can also include links, so that you can provide a link to a new version of the tool or similar.

    If the custom notification was activated, the end-user will see it in form of a pop-up when they open the tool in the client:

    .. figure:: images/editor/custom_message_client.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The notification that the user gets to see

      *The notification that the user gets to see*


* **Include a logo which links to an external website**: (Optional)
    Your sector might already have chosen a logo that will appear in the bottom
    left corner of the OiRA risk assessment application.

    This logo can be clicked and links to the homepage of the OiRA risk
    assessment site (https://client.oiraproject.eu).

    There is another option to include a logo which links
    back to a selected web page. This logo will appear on the first page that
    end-users visit as soon as they start with a risk assessment (the Preparation step).

    If you tick the checkbox "Include a logo which links to an external website", 3 more fields will appear.

    .. figure:: images/editor/editor_client_example_logos.png

      *An example of end-user facing OiRA risk assessment site (OiRA client), showing the two different logos. Logo "1" is the logo pointing to the external organisation that we just entered. Logo "2" is the sector's logo.*

    * **External site URL**
        This is the URL (website address) of the external website you would like the logo to link to.
    * **External site name**
        This is the name of the website or its organisation
    * **External site logo**
        Here you should provide an image file of the logo

      :alt: The 3 extra fields for adding a logo linking to an external website

      *The 3 extra fields for adding a logo linking to an external website*


.. _custom_estimation_help:

*  **The criteria applied to evaluate risks are specific of this tool? (If not, the common criteria descriptions will apply).**
    With this setting, the hints displayed to the end user when a risk's severity needs to be calculated can be customised.

    On a regular risk that is set to be "calculated" for its severity, the end user is presented with some questions in case the risk is present. The answer to those questions are used to calculate the severity. Next to every question, a help text is available that gives some hints to the user.

    .. figure:: images/editor/evaluation_calculated_standard_hint.png
      :align: center
      :height: 250px
      :alt: The hint for one of the questions to evaluate the severity of the risk

      *The hint for one of the questions to evaluate the severity of the risk (standard text)*

    In case a tool creator wants to present different hints to the user, they can use this option to set custom texts.

      :align: center
      :alt: Entering a custom hint text for the evaluation questions

      *A hint with custom text for one of the questions to evaluate the severity of the risk*


==============
Formatted Text
==============

In certain forms in the OiRA tools generator, you will see larger fields in which you can add both plain and formatted text (*also known as rich text*).

You will be able to identify this option from the editor-bar directly above such fields
(the “formatting bar”). In case there are multiple fields for rich text on a single page,
each of them will have its own formatting bar.

    .. figure:: images/editor/editor_formatting_bar.png
      :align: center
      :height: 410 px
      :alt: Example of a rich text field with the formatting bar above it

      *Example of a rich text field with the formatting bar above it*

It is important that you only copy a not formatted text into the field.
**Pasting formatted text from another program, e.g. Word, Excel, etc. may later cause displaying
problems in the OiRA website for end-users (client)**, since it already contains markup code that can disrupt the correct display.

You will not see this code when you paste the text onto the OiRA tools generator, but it does exist
“underneath” the text. Hyperlinks also have a fixed format in Word (colour
and underlining), which is difficult to change after pasting onto the OiRA tools generator. It is
best to insert hyperlinks **after** the text has been entered correctly
into the OiRA tools generator (see the explanation further below on how to create links).

Therefore, please **keep in mind that pasting text from another program can cause
unexpected effects**. This applies to all fields in the OiRA tools generator where formatting is possible.
This is why we advise you to type the text into the field without formatting,
instead of pasting from a program. If you decide to paste text from a program, make sure that the text is not formatted.
For instance, you can copy text from a Word document to a Notepad document
(Notepad is a standard program available in almost all computers); Notepad
does not support formatting the formatting will be deleted,
and you can copy again from Notepad to OiRA.

The formatting bar offers the following options:

* **Bold**:
    You select (by dragging the mouse) a portion of text and then click **B** in the formatting bar above the field.

    Selecting the same text again and clicking **B** will undo the bold font (this applies to all formatting options).

* **Italic**:
    You select (by dragging the mouse) a portion of text and click on the **I** in the formatting bar above the field.

* **Listings:**
    You select the required lines and click on the icon with the dots and stripes. Then chose either **Unordered list** for a list with bullet points or **Ordered list** for a numbered list.

* **Hyperlink (to a website):**
    First type the text on which you would like to apply the hyperlink, for example: “Also see this website”.
    Then highlight the text (by dragging the mouse), click on the button with the chain icon in the formatting bar and select "Insert link"

      :height: 300px
      :alt: Adding a hyperlink to formatted text

      *Adding a hyperlink to formatted text*

    A new window will then open which allows you to add the *URL*. The *Text* of the link is pre-filled by the text that you had highlighted.

      :alt: Filling in the details for a hyperlink

      *Filling in the details for a hyperlink*

    * **URL**:
        The address of the web page you want to link to, this must start with: 'https://' or 'http://'.
    * **Text**:
        The title will appear in the tooltip when a person hovers their mouse cursor above the hyperlink.
    * **Open link in new window**:
        Clicking on the link will open a new web page. By opening that web page in a new browser window (or tab), your user will not lose the current open page (i.e. the OiRA risk assessment site).

    **To modify a link** or **to delete a link** simple click on the link. A context menu opens with the options to *Edit* (opening the window you already now from adding the link) or to *Unlink* (removing the hyperlink but keeping the text):

      :alt: Adding a hyperlink to formatted text

      *Adding a hyperlink to formatted text*

    .. note::

        URLs are the addresses of websites or web resources. Therefore, if you want to add a
        hyperlink, it must point to a website address. If you would like to offer actual documents
        (e.g. Word or PDF files) on your OiRA tool, you first have to place the documents
        onto a website (e.g. the site of your sector's organisation) and then create a link to these files as described above.

With 'Ctrl-z' (the *Ctrl* key together with the *z* key) you can undo formatting and textual changes you made in the formatted text field (multiple changes can be undone, as long as you haven't clicked 'Save').

In addition, you can click the right button of your mouse when you are in
a field, which will provide you with an applicable menu. When you select a
word you will also see options such as: cut, copy, paste, etc.

Alternatively, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

* Copy: Ctrl-c.

* Paste: Ctrl-v.

* Cut: Ctrl-x.

* Select all: Ctrl-a.

* Undo: Ctrl-z.

* Search (within the field): Ctrl-f.


.. _oira-tool-versions:

==================
OiRA tool versions
==================

An OiRA tool should be revised periodically, usually to adapt it to the latest
changes in legislation or other environmental changes.
The OiRA tools generator makes this easy by allowing you to create and manage
several different versions of your OiRA tool.


When you :ref:`create a new OiRA tool <create-oira-tool>`, the first version is automatically added. By default, it is titled *Standard*. In the sector overview page, we'll see the heading of the OiRA tool (here called “Cockles and Mussels“) as well its first version (“Standard”).

   .. figure:: images/editor/editor_oira_tool_versions.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The new OiRA tool together with its first version

      *The new OiRA tool together with its first version*

Having multiple versions is a very useful feature for a variety of reasons.

* Whenever you need to make risky or invasive changes to your OiRA tool, you can create a new version to experiment with, while having the peace of mind that there is still a fully functional copy of the currently deployed OiRA tool.
* Having different versions, together with the preview function, allows easy and rapid prototyping without affecting the OiRA tool currently available to the end-users.
* Once you have tested a new version, you can publish that specific version, thereby replacing the previous one.
* Older versions can be kept for documentation purposes, indicating the history and eventual changes brought to the OiRA tool.

Updating an existing OiRA tool version usually requires you to only do minimal changes to adapt it to latest amendments in legislation or new findings. In this case you don't want to create a new OiRA tool version from scratch but instead copy the old one and make amendments.

**Steps for creating a new OiRA tool version:**

#. Make sure you are on the context of an OiRA tool or one of its versions.
    You will see on the right side a column named **VERSIONS**.
#. Mark an OiRA tool version by clicking on the radio button next to its name.

    .. figure:: images/editor/editor_19_create_new_version.png
        :align: center
        :height: 200px
        :alt: Creating a new OiRA tool version by copying an existing one

        *Creating a new OiRA tool version by copying an existing one*

#. Click the *Duplicate* button.
#. Provide a Title

   .. figure:: images/editor/editor_20_tool_version_form.png
      :align: center
      :height: 200px
      :alt: The “new OiRA tool version” add form

      *The “new OiRA tool version“ add form*

#. Make sure the correct base revision is selected. Base revision refers to the version of the tool you want to base the new version on. In our example we only have one version (Standard).
#. Click the *Create* button.

Now you have a second OiRA tool version available and on which you can make changes that won't affect the original version. Once you are done, you can publish it and it will replace the existing OiRA tool in the client.



======================================
Creating the structure of an OiRA tool
======================================

When completing/modifying the content it is essential to first consider the structure that you will give your OiRA tool.

With structure, we refer to the layout of *profile questions*, *modules* and *submodules*, as well as their contained *risks* and *measures*.

Within a *module* or *profile question*, you can either add *submodules* or *risks*; a combination of both isn't possible. You can however add *risks* to a *submodule*.

----------------------------------------------
Copying or moving elements inside an OiRA tool
----------------------------------------------

When you base the OiRA tool on an existing OiRA tool, it will already have a
structure. Main modules and submodules may be added to, or removed from any part of
this structure. You can also copy and move modules, both within the OiRA tool
and to other OiRA tools under your management (visible on the overview on the left).

Click on the item which you would like to copy or move, and open the menu
*Actions* (top right, next to *Edit*). Choose the desired option (Copy or, go to the area where you
want to move it (click in the desired OiRA tool and folder) and choose
*Paste* from the *Actions* menu.

.. _library:

----------------------------------------
Using the Library to copy useful content
----------------------------------------

Even though sectors and legislation differ across states, a lot of problems and risks are common, as are the proposed solutions. For this reason, EU-OSHA provides a library of risk assessment modules that can be re-used by all tool creators.

To get an overview of what the library contains, you can use the link on the start page of the CMS and browse the contents.

    .. figure:: images/editor/editor_library_link.png
      :align: center
      :height: 300px
      :alt: The link to the library on the start page of the CMS

      *The link to the library on the start page of the CMS*

The purpose of the library however is to provide easy access for copying relevant content to your own tool. When you are browsing your own tool, you will see a button “Library” in the same bar that also contains the “Edit” button.

    .. figure:: images/editor/editor_library_use.png
      :align: center
      :height: 250px
      :alt: Access to the library inside an OiRA tool - here on the top level of a tool

      *Access to the library inside an OiRA tool - here on the top level of a tool*

After clicking this button, you will see the contents of the library ready for you to insert into your own tool. Only one library tool can be displayed at a time, therefore you can switch to the tool that you need by using the selector. For every item that is available for copying, you will see an “Insert” button next to it.

    .. figure:: images/editor/editor_library_select_source.png
      :align: center
      :height: 500px
      :alt: The library contents, ready to be inserted into your tool

      *The library contents, ready to be inserted into your tool*

The selector lets you access all tools that are available in the library.

      :align: center
      :height: 250px
      :alt: The selector of tools inside the library

      *The selector to switch between tools inside the library*

Once you have decided which content you want to copy into your own tool, click the *Insert* button. You will then be taken back to your own tool, where you will see a copy of the module or risk that you have just copied.

      *A module has just been copied from the library*

The library only allows you to insert that type of content that is allowed by the current context. That means,

* if you open the library from the top of your tool, you will be able to insert modules and profile questions
* if you open the library from inside a module that already contains risks, you will be able to insert risks
* if you open the library from inside a module that contains submodules, you will be able to add modules

In the following screen-shot, the library was opened from inside a module that already contains some risks. Therefore, only the risks inside the library have the *Insert* button, but not the modules.

      *The library, opened from a module that already contains risks*

.. note::

    All content that you copy from the library becomes part of your own OiRA tool. You can then proceed to modify it as it suits your needs. There is no connection to the content inside the library. That means if the library gets updated, your copied content will not be affected.


-----------------
Profile questions
-----------------

What are profile questions?
---------------------------

Profile Questions are special modules whose contents may be skipped entirely
or repeated a certain number of times.

Profile questions are posed to the end-user **before** they start the risk assessment, during the preparation phase.

A profile question starts by posing a question, the answer to which will determine
whether the profile question's contents will be skipped or not.

    * *Do you have a store?*

If the end-user answers *No*, the submodules and/or risks inside that profile
question will not appear during the subsequent risk assessment.

If the end-user answers *Yes*, the profile question's contents will be
included in the risk assessment and another question is posed to determine
the amount of times the contents of the profile question needs to be evaluated.

    * *Do you have multiple stores?*

If the end-user answers *No*, they must still provide a name for the single
instance or occurrence referred to by the profile question (in this case, one
store).

If the end-user answers *Yes*, they will be prompted to
provide a name for each of the repeating instances or occurrences (i.e. for
each store).

As you can see, **profile questions enable the end-user to include or exclude certain
parts** of the risk assessment tool, depending on whether they apply to the
their particular situation or not.

They can also be made **repeatable**, allowing the end-user to name the repeating instances
with names relevant to them (e.g. city centre bakery, bakery headquarters,
bakery city park).

Through this, the (sub)modules and risks associated with
this **repeatable** profile will be repeated in the tool - once for each affected instance.
Imagine this to be the same as if you would make paper copies of a certain part of
a checklist, because it needs to be completed for each location's characteristics.

Posing profile questions is particularly useful in sectors where it is probable
that a substantial number of modules with risks aren't relevant to all
companies. If you expect that most companies will complete practically all
modules, posing profile questions will be unnecessary, unless you would like to
provide the end-user the option of completing part of the modules multiple times.

    *A profile question example*


Adding profile questions
------------------------

You can create profile questions as follows: click on the top level of the OiRA tool
(top link in the navigation tree on the left-hand side) and in the grey
bar underneath the title you will find the button *Add Profile Question*.

You will see the following page:

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_10_profile_question.png
    :align: center
    :height: 380px
    :alt: The profile question add form

    *The profile question add form*

The following fields are available:

    * **Title**:
        The title will appear prominently above the profile question,
        in the beginning of the OiRA tool, during the **Preparation** phase of the risk assessment, and also inside the navigation of the tool.

        Don't put a full-stop after the title. A number isn't needed, either.

    * **Question**:
        This is the question that determines whether the profile question's
        contents will be skipped or not.
        This question appears under the profile question title, at the beginning of the OiRA tool,
        during the **Preparation** phase.

        For example:

            *Does your organisation provide mobile patrolling?*

    * **Ask the user about (multiple) locations?**
        If this setting is enabled, the user will be asked to provide a label for each location / instance that will be checked against the contents of this profile. Using this settings makes the profile repeatable.

    * **Multiple item question**:
        This question will be posed to the user only if they have answered *Yes* to
        the preceding question, and must be designed to determine whether the
        profile question contents needs to be repeated or not.

        For example:

            *Do you offer this service in multiple locations?*

    * **Single occurrence prompt**:
        This is the question that will be posed to the user if they have
        answered *No* to the previous question, i.e. there is only one instance
        or occurrence. It must prompt the user to provide a name for that
        single instance/occurrence.

        For example:

            *Please enter the name for the location you want to assess*

    * **Multiple occurrence prompt**:
        This is the question that will be posed to the user if they have
        answered *Yes* to the *Multiple item question*, i.e. there is more than
        one instance or occurrence. It must prompt the user to provide a name
        for each instance/occurrence.

        For example:

            *Please enter the name for each location you want to assess*


A profile question acts as a module, in the sense that it is a container. You can now add modules and/or risks to it. Do that by clicking the "Add Module" or the "Add Risk" button.

=======
Modules
=======

When the module structure is clear and the decision has been made whether
profile questions will be posed or not, it is a good idea to first completely
build the module structure into the OiRA tools generator. Only after that should you
add the risks to the modules. It is not useful to start adding
risks to modules when the structure has not yet been determined.

----------------
Optional modules
----------------

Instead of determining which modules apply to the end-user by asking
profile questions, there's also the possibility of initially offering all
modules and giving the end-users the option to skip a module just before starting it.

During the **Identification** phase, while the end-user is going through the
structure and comes upon an optional module, they will be posed a question
designed to determine whether that module is applicable to the specific
end-user (and therefore whether it may be skipped or not).

This so-called 'filter question' for optional modules must be expressed in an affirmative way.

For example:

    *Dangerous substances are used*

As such, the end-user will initially deal with the module *Dangerous
substances*. If the end-user answers with *No* to this statement they will
skip the whole module and its contents.
It isn't possible to skip modules by answering *Yes* to a filter
question, only by answering *No*.

The optional module feature can be used also at sub-modules level.

Take into account that filter questions for optional modules should NOT refer to risks.
For risks you can use the “not applicable” option (see more information below).

Only one filter question may be used for each module/sub-module. It is always the
first question (as affirmative statement) that is displayed in the module.

It is useful to start determining which modules could or should start with
a filter question during the preparation of the module structure.
See below for information on how to enter an optional module.

---------------
Adding a module
---------------

When you are on an OiRA tool, or inside a profile question, or inside a module that does not contain any risks, you can create a new module by clicking the *Add Module* button, as shown in the screen-shot below.

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_9_creating_modules.png
    :align: center
    :alt: The location of the *Add Module* button

    *The location of the “Add Module” button*

You will the see the following form:

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_11_add_module.png
    :align: center
    :height: 700px
    :alt:  The *Add Module* form

    *The Add Module form*

with the following fields:

   **Title**:
        The title of this module, for instance *Storage room*,
        *Working at height* or *Physical Work*, etc. The end-user will see this
        title at the top of the page for the duration of answering this
        module's risks. Don't put a full stop after the title. A number
        isn't needed either, since the module will be numbered automatically.
        Keep it short and simple. Use everyday language and make sure the end-user
        will immediately understand it.

   **Description**:
        Provide a short general description of the contents
        of the module. This is a `formatted text`_ field, so you can create links
        to useful external pages providing additional relevant information.

   **This module is optional**:
        Please refer to the explanation on `optional modules`_ above.

        Ticking this box will make the module optional, determined by the
        answer to a 'filter question' posed to the user.

        If you have decided to make the module optional by ticking this box,
        an extra field labelled *Question* will appear, in
        which you must write the 'filter question' as an affirmative statement

        .. figure:: images/editor/editor_optional_module.png
            :align: center
            :alt:  Making a module optional

            *Making a module optional*

        The answer has to be *Yes* or *No*. If *No* is answered,
        the end-user will skip the module (as explained above).

   **Image file**:
        You can add an image that will be shown along with the module's title and description. Please use a JPEG, PNG or GIF file and make sure that the image is of high quality and is not scaled down. Large images will automatically be scaled to the correct size.

   **Solution overview**:
        At the modular level, generic/orienting solutions could be provided.
        For example it could be important to stress the importance
        of avoiding the risk, substituting the dangerous by the non-(or less)
        dangerous, combating risk at source. The solution could focus
        on different aspects: technical and/or organisational, ...

        The text you enter here will appear in the **Action Plan** phase.
        This Overview of solution at module level should be compatible/complementary
        with the measure(s) proposed at risk level.

    **Additonal content**
        You can upload up to four files that might supplement the contents of the module or aid the end-user in their risk assessment. These files will be shown on the module in the client. If you do not provide a content caption, then the file name will be shown to the user:

        .. figure:: images/editor/module_additional_content.png
            :align: center
            :height: 250px
            :alt:  “Additional content” files shown on a module

            *“Additional content” files shown on a module*



Once you have filled in the forms, click *Save* at the bottom of the screen.

To add more top-level modules, click again on the top link in the navigation tree on the left and then click the button *Add Module*.

To add a submodule to the current module, click on the module where you want to add the submodule. Then click *Add Submodule* on the top bar.

You can modify modules and submodules as well as all other information you enter at a later stage by clicking the *Edit* button.

With the Action menu (top right) you can cut, copy and delete modules and by dragging them (up or down) you can change order of appearance. You should do this before publishing the OiRA tool.

=====
Risks
=====

------------
Adding Risks
------------

A risk is always placed inside a module, submodule or profile question.
Make sure you are in the correct context by selecting the module, submodule or profile
question from the left-side navigation.

.. note::
    You cannot add risks in the top level of the OiRA tool.

Once on the correct context in which you want to add the risk, click *Add Risk*
in the grey bar underneath the title.

You will then see the following form similar to this (the form might slightly
differ in case you have chosen the 2-criteria evaluation when creating the tool):

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_12_add_risk.png
    :align: center
    :alt: The “Add Risk” form, upper part

    *The “Add Risk” form, upper part*

    *The “Add Risk” form, middle part (Evaluation)*

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_12c_add_risk.png
    :align: center
    :alt: The “Add Risk” form, lower part (Images and additional content)

    *The “Add Risk” form, lower part (Images and additional content)*

**Affirmative Statement**:
    Write a short affirmative statement about a possible risk

    For example:
        *The floors are free of obstacles.*

    Put a full stop after the statement.
    For more information on how to properly formulate risk statements, see the section on
    `formulating risks`_ below.

**Negative Statement**:
    This is the inverse of the affirmative statement.
    This field is mandatory as the negative statement will appear in the
    **Evaluation** and **Action plan** steps (i.e. if the end-user answers NO to the affirmative statement).

    Note: the negative statement doesn’t necessarily have to be a simple
    negative version of the positive statement, since saying "no" to the
    positive statement can lead to different conclusions.

    For example:
        - *The floors are not free of obstacles.*

        - *It is not guaranteed that the floors are always free of obstacles.*

        - *It is possible that floors are sometimes occupied by obstacles.*

**Description**:
    Describe the risk and provide the end-user with any relevant
    information. This is a `formatted text`_ field, so you can create links
    to useful external pages providing additional relevant information.

    For example in the statement above, put a clarification/explanation of the exact meaning of
    the type of obstacles you refer to.

**Legal and Policy References**:
    Provide relevant legal information related to the risk/topic/issue.
    This is a `formatted text`_ field, so you can create links to useful external pages providing additional relevant information.

**Identification**:

    * **Show 'not applicable' option**
        If ticked, the user will be presented the possibility to answer with *Not Applicable*.
        Otherwise they only have the options *Yes* or *No*.

        This is useful for risks of which you can't predict whether they will be relevant to the end-user or not.

**Evaluation**:


    **Risk type**:
    There are 3 types of risk which you can choose from.

    Risks that have been identified by the end-user,
    need to be assigned a priority, and the risk's type determines
    what this priority will be or how it will be calculated.

    #. **Priority risk**:
        Refers to a risk considered by the sector/authorities among the high risks in the sector.

        Risks of this type automatically receive a priority of *high*, so
        end-users will not be asked to evaluate them.

        If you choose this option, all subsequent fields under the
        *Evaluation* section in the form will disappear (since they won't
        be applicable anymore).

    #. **Risk**:
        Refers to the existing risks at the workplace or linked to the work
        carried out. To identify and evaluate such risks it is often necessary to
        examine the workplace (to walk around the workplace and look at what could
        cause harm; consult workers, etc.).

        For this "risk" type, the developer has to choose an evaluation method.
        The developer can choose from three options of evaluation methods:

            * **Estimated**:

                .. figure:: images/editor/editor_14_risk_evaluation_estimated.png
                    :align: center
                    :height: 300px
                    :alt: When choosing “Estimated” as the evaluation method, you also need to set a default priority.

                    *When choosing “Estimated” as the evaluation method, you also need to set a default priority.*

                During the **Evaluation** phase of the OiRA tool assessment, the
                end-user will determine the priority of a risk by selecting a value of **high, medium** or **low**.
                The developer can also choose a **default priority** that will appear to the end users who can nevertheless overrule it.

            * **Calculated**:
                In this case, the risk's priority will be automatically calculated from the
                values of 2 or 3 different criteria, depending on the *evaluation algorithm*
                employed by the OiRA Tool, selected when you create the tool.
                For each criterion the developer can choose a default or
                leave the "no default" option(s). Providing a default
                gives an orientation to the end user how to evaluate the
                risk. However the end-user is always free to overrule the
                default recommendation.

                If the evaluation algorithm is the *Kinney method*, then the 3 criteria
                are:

                **Probability**:
                How high is the probability that this risk will occur?

                **Frequency**:
                How often is one exposed to this risk?

                **Severity**:
                How severe is the danger posed by this risk?

                If the algorithm is the *simplified, 2 criteria* version, only *severity* and *frequency*
                (sometimes also referred to as *exposure*) are used as criteria.

                The values for these criteria are supplied by the end-user during the
                **Evaluation** phase, but you, as the developer, are
                able to provide default values.

                .. figure:: images/editor/editor_13_evaluation_risk.png
                    :align: center
                    :height: 400px

                    *When choosing “Calculated” as the evaluation method, you may also set the default values for the calculation parameters.*

            * **Evaluation-free**:
                In this case, you must set the priority to a fixed value. The end-user will not evaluate
                the risk at all, because it will not show up in the evaluation phase.

                .. figure:: images/editor/editor_skip_evaluation.png

                    *When choosing to let the user skip the evaluation, you need to set the priority yourself.*

        Option **"Risk is always present"**

          If this option is selected, then the end-user will always see this risk as being present when they are filling in the OiRA tool in the client. It will behave as if the user had answered "No", but without the possibility that the user can change this answer. All available evaluation methods can be used with this option. Compared to regular risks there are no differences regarding the action plan.

                    :align: center

                    *An info-bubble informs about the consequences of selecting this option.*

    #. **Policy**:
        Refers to agreements, procedures, management decisions regarding
        OSH issues. These issues can be answered behind a desk (no need to examine the
        workplace).

        Risks of this type are strictly speaking not risks
        and therefore won't be evaluated by the end-users (during the
        **Evaluation** phase of the risk assessment).
        They are "high priority" by default.

**Main Image and Secondary Images**:

    On the risk page you can add images. One Main image, which will appear on a
    prominent position and up to three secondary images, which will appear below.
    You should use these images to help describe the risk situation and eventually
    also the correct situation as a contrast.

    .. figure:: images/editor/add_risk_images.png

        :height: 250px
        :alt: The section on the risk edit form for adding images

        *The The section on the risk edit form for adding images*


    You will have to upload these images yourself. Make sure that the
    images are clear and legible, not too large
    in surface size (maximum 300 x 300 pixels on the screen) and file size
    (maximum 100 kB). Give the image a clear file name, without spaces (for
    example: Danger_logo.jpg). When the image is ready to upload, select
    it from your computer by using the *Choose file* button. The location and file
    name will appear in the field.

    This function will only allow you to upload images with a 'gif', 'jpeg' or 'png'
    extension. Any other files will first have to be placed onto a website and
    can be linked to from the text.

**Additional Content**

    If you have additional content (files such as PDF, Word or Excel documents) that can help explain a risk situation, you can add up to four such documents here.

        :height: 250px
        :alt: The section on the risk edit form for adding additional content

        *The section on the risk edit form for adding additional content*

    In the OiRA application, the user will see a link to each of the uploaded files that allows them to download them. If you provide a caption for a file, this will be displayed to the user, otherwise the file-name will be shown:

    .. figure:: images/editor/editor_additional_content.png
       :align: center
       :height: 350px
       :alt: Additional content shown in the OiRA application

       *Additional content shown in the OiRA application*


Once you are done, click on *Save* (at the bottom of the page).


Formulating risks
-----------------

Risks should have the form of statements. Avoid words such as *not / no / never* in the affirmative statement
(and also in profile questions). Given that the end-user can only answer with
'Yes' or 'No', a statement containing the word 'not' combined with the answer 'No'
can lead to confusion.

For instance, the following statement:

    *There are no obstacles or trailing cables on the floors*

should be reformulated to:

    *Floors are free from obstacles or trailing cables*

When reformulation is not a possibility, try to clarify with an
explanation in the description what will happen when the end-user answers with 'No'.

For example:

    *By answering 'No', there is a risk, when answering 'Yes', there is no
    risk.*

.. note::
    For all statements, the answer 'No' always indicates that there's a risk
    and the answer 'Yes' indicates there isn't a risk.

Any answers other than *Yes* and *No* are not possible, except for *Not
Applicable* if that option has been selected.

----------------------
Solutions and Measures
----------------------

One of the goals of this tool is to help users with information on how to solve
problems they encounter during the process. This is done by providing typical
solutions to general problem areas (by module) or measures for addressing specific problems (by risk).

Solutions - at module level
---------------------------

Edit the module and add the text in the “Solution” field. This text should contain an approach for the user on how to tackle the risks described in that module in a general way. This information will be displayed in the Action Plan on the module level before the specific risks of that module are handled.

.. _measures-risk-level:

Measures - at risk level
------------------------

It is most comfortable for the end-user if you provide one or more measures for each risk, because then the user will be able to pick measures with a click to pre-populate the action plan form.

A measure is related to a concrete risk. On a risk, click on *Add Measure* in the grey bar to open the Add / Edit form.

        *The “Add Measure” form*

**Description**:

    This is the heading that will appear in a drop-down in the Action Plan
    phase of the client; it is the first and only information the end-user
    will see before actually selecting the measure, so it needs to be
    informative.
    Start with words which reflect the core message of the
    measure, for example: *Information and instruction on personal protection measures*,
    and then offer the rest. This text helps to get the end-user started
    and explains the possibilities.

**General approach** (to eliminate or reduce the risk):
    Describe what is your general approach to eliminate or (if the risk
    is not avoidable) reduce the risk.
    This text will be incorporated into the Action plan.

    For example:
        *Ensure the correct means of Personal Protection are used, according to...*

**Specific action(s) required to implement this approach**:
    Describe the specific action(s) required to implement this approach
    (to eliminate or to reduce the risk).

    For example:
        * *Appoint person responsible for information on and provision of personal protection measures*
        * *Set a date for an information session and invite staff*
        * *Check if personal protective equipment is sufficient and well maintained*
        * *...etc.*

**Level of expertise and/or requirements needed**:
    Describe the level of expertise needed to implement the measure,

    For example:
        * *Common sense (no OSH knowledge required)*
    or
        * *No specific OSH expertise, but minimum OSH knowledge or training and/or consultation of OSH guidance required*
    or
        * *OSH expert*

    You can also describe here any other additional requirement (if any).
    For example: budgeting, training for Prevention/Safety staff, incorporating
    this subject in team meetings, etc.

If the end-user selects this measure it will be copied over to the Action plan. The end-users can rework and modify the supplied text.

Customizing OiRA to reflect your organisation's logo
====================================================

You may customize the way the OiRA risk assessment tool will appear to
end-users to let it reflect your organisation's logo.

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_edit_sector_link.png
    :align: center
    :height: 350px
    :alt: The “Edit” link on a sector

    *The “Edit” link on a sector*

You will then see a form similar to the one shown in the image below.

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_16_selecting_colours.png
    :align: center
    :height: 550px
    :alt: The “Settings” form for a sector

    *The “Settings” form for a sector (with a custom logo already present)*

Without customisation, the standard OiRA logo is displayed on the sidebar of the client. But you may also upload your sector's own logo.


Under *Logo* you check the box *My own*, then click on *Choose file* to navigate on your computer for selecting the image to upload. Finally, click on *Save* at the bottom of the page. You can change the image at a later date if needed, or switch back to the standard logo.

For best results, take a transparent 'PNG' file with a height of at least 110 pixels. Larger logos will be resized automatically.



=======================
Checking your OiRA tool
=======================

When all the work has been done, i.e. the structure and contents have been completed,
you can preview your OiRA tool (prior to making it public) following these steps:

#. Make sure you have an end-user account in the OiRA tool (https://oiraproject.eu/oira-tools/) You create an account in the OiRA client here https://oiraproject.eu/oira-tools/@@register
#. In the *Versions drawer* (see `OiRA tool versions`_) on the right hand, chose the version you want to preview and, click the *Preview* link next to your OiRA tool version.

      :align: center
      :height: 250px
      :alt: The preview confirmation form

      *The preview confirmation form*

#. Click on the Preview URL


#. Log into the tool with your end-user account
#. View your (still unpublished) OiRA tool

   .. tip::

     Check as many boxes as possible on the profile page, answer the filter
     questions with 'Yes' and the risks with 'No'. This way you will view all
     risks and possibilities.

   When you discover faults in the preview you can amend these in the OiRA tools generator.
   Access the Preview again to check your modifications.

   .. note::

     The preview is stored in a separate place on the server, it won't be
     viewable to the end-users until you publish the OiRA tool.

===============
Ready? Publish!
===============

Once you've successfully completed all steps it's time to publish your
OiRA tool.

Go to the right hand menu, click on the version of the tool you want to publish and click on "Publish".

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_18b_publish_survey.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Publishing your OiRA tool

    *Publishing your OiRA tool*

.. note::
    It can take some time to perform this action.

When you click on Publish, you will be asked if you are sure you want to publish the tool.
Before confirming, copy the URL (link) of the tool that is provided on this page and
save it in a secure place (after the confirmation, the URL will disappear).
This URL will be the access point of your tool in the OiRA client.

A confirmation message will appear in a green bar:

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_18_publish_survey.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Publish confirmation message

    *Publish confirmation message*

From now on, the public can view and complete your OiRA tool. In case of a
new OiRA tool, contact the OiRA team at EU-OSHA at least two weeks before you
publish the tool. This way EU-OSHA can ensure that your tool will be included
on the OiRA project site (http://www.oiraproject.eu). You don't have to notify
the OiRA team when you have updated the OiRA tool.

.. _measures-in-place:

===================================================
Special OiRA tool with already implemented measures
===================================================

The standard structure of a risk assessment in OiRA for the user looks as follows:

* A positive statement is presented that describes a desired state, such as “Regular maintenance is performed”.
* The user can either confirm this with a Yes (no risk present) or decline with a No, meaning that the desired stated is not (yet) present.
* In this case, the OiRA tools knows that this risk is present at the user's organisation. Therefore, the user needs to handle this risk in the Action Plan, and plan measures to mitigate this risk **in the future**.

In other words, OiRA assumes by its structure that a user always starts a risk assessment from scratch: OiRA helps the user to identify a risk, and then plan preventive measures.

In reality, many organisations might already have given thought to their situation regarding safety and health at work. For at least some of the risks that affect a workplace, preventive measures might **already be in place**. Example: A hazardous area has been fenced off, a warning sign has been placed, personal protective gear is being used, ...

In a standard OiRA tool, the user can only plan for measures that are still required. But it might be desirable to also document the measures that have already been implemented, for example in a report that documents the overall state of the risk assessment and prevention.

Therefore, an OiRA tool can be switched from the ”Classic” (i.e. standard) variant to a type that enables the user to define measures that have already been implemented. See the :ref:`chapter about editing an OiRA tool <enable-measures-in-place>` on how to switch the type of tool.

.. figure:: images/editor/cms-measures-in-place.png

    :alt: OiRA client: risk statement, with suggested measures shown to the user that they can mark as already being implemented

    *OiRA client: risk statement, with suggested measures shown to the user that they can mark as already being implemented*


This will have the following effect in the OiRA application for the end-user:

* On each risk in the identification phase, an additional instruction will be displayed after the risk statement: “Select or add any measures that are already in place”.
* All measures that were :ref:`defined by the tool creator for this risk <measures-risk-level>` are shown as selectable items to the user.
* Apart from selecting (= confirming) the appropriate items, the user can also add additional measures that have been implemented in their organisation to tackle this risk.
* The actual identification is pre-fixed with a **question**: “Are the measures that are selected above sufficient?”, to make it clear that the assessment of the risk needs to consider the concrete situation in the user's organisation. The Yes / No answer does not relate to the risk statement.
* The **answers** below have the same effect as in a classic OiRA tool: “Yes (the remaining risk is acceptable)” means that the risk is under control and will not appear in the Action Plan. “No (more measures are required)” means that the risk will be added to the Action Plan so that further measures can be planned.

    :alt: OiRA client: the user has selected one pre-defined measure and written text for an additional custom measure.

    *OiRA client: the user has selected one pre-defined measure and written text for an additional custom measure.*


In the Action Plan, all measures that have already been implemented are shown for information. Since there is no action required for them, they cannot be edited or scheduled. But new measures (to be implemented in the future) can still be added just as with a classic OiRA tool.

================================
Re-working a published OiRA tool
================================

In the life-time of an OiRA tool, changes will become necessary, e.g. due to changed legislation, based on user feedback or following re-structuring inside a sector. This chapter provides you with guidelines to follow when you want to make changes to an OiRA tool that has already been published.

The most important aspect to consider is the **impact on existing users of this OiRA tool**: Will the changes that you want to introduce cause existing users to lose (parts of) their answers? Will a user who has already done a risk assessment based on your tool still be able to download the report for it?

Here are some considerations to help you decide how to proceed:

-----------------------------
Changes that are not critical
-----------------------------

If you simply add new risks or modules, then existing users will see the new contents (modules and risks) appearing in their existing session, without answers of course.

This kind of change is not critical. Existing users only need to fill in the blanks when they return to their saved sessions.

In similar fashion, you can update *already existing* modules, sub-modules, risks, profile questions or measures *in place*. This means: in the CMS, you might change title, description, type of risk, attachments, etc. Existing users will simply see the updated texts, images, etc., but their answers stay intact.

This kind of change is also not critical.
*Exception*: the change in wording changes the meaning of a risk statement or similar in such a way that a previous risk assessment is no longer valid.

For these kind of changes, it is safe to do the changes in place, so that the URL of the OiRA tool will stay the same. More details below under “Option 1”.


--------------------------------------
Changes that require special attention
--------------------------------------

Any change to the structure of an OiRA tool is potentially dangerous with regards to the answers of existing users. Examples:

* A risk gets moved from one (sub-) module to another.
* A module gets moved into a profile question (or the other way around).
* Two modules get combined into one, or one module gets split into 2 modules.

In all these case, the affected risks / modules receive a new “parent” in the tool. For existing risk assessments, the software will then not know any more that the answers from the user (the Yes/No + the measures) belong to a risk that has a different parent. That means, the answers will be lost.

Therefore, for changes that affect the structure of an OiRA tool, the recommendation is to **create a new tool that has a different URL than the old version**. This will allow existing users to keep accessing their risk assessment (including the report) under the old URL, while all new users will be sent to the new URL of the tool. More details under “Option 2”.

The potential drawback is that all users who want to benefit from the new version of the OiRA tool need to perform the risk assessment from scratch. This is not relevant for new users, but existing users will have to answer all questions again, in case they want to use the new version. It is not possible to copy over previously given answers or measures.


-----------------------------------
Option 1: Replacing a tool in place
-----------------------------------

The simplest form of making changes in place is to edit the risks / modules in the CMS and then re-publishing the tool when you are finished. This is especially relevant for minor changes like fixing typos, adjusting links, etc.

For larger changes (but ones that do not affect the structure), you might want to keep the current version in the CMS and apply your changes in a new version (of the same OiRA tool). This can have the benefit that you can already work on the changes for the new version. But it will allow you to still make adjustments to the current version (e.g. fixing typos) without having to make all changes live. Once you publish the new verion, the existing tool in the client will be replaced by the new version (**under the same URL**).

See the :ref:`chapter on OiRA tool versions <oira-tool-versions>` on how to create a new version.

-------------------------------------------------------
Option 2: Creating a new version in a separate location
-------------------------------------------------------

:ref:`Create a new OiRA tool <create-oira-tool>`, pick the option “Base my new OiRA Tool on an existing OiRA Tool of my organisation” and select the old tool you wish to copy from.

The new OiRA tool will be created in a new location as a copy. All modules, profiles, risks, etc. are copied. You can now safely re-arrange the structure.

And when you publish the OiRA tool, **it will have a different URL**.

---------------------
Communication aspects
---------------------

These are especially relevant for option 2.

Prevent new users from using the old tool
-----------------------------------------

Any user who has an existing risk assessment from of the old version will still see it when they log in to OiRA on the list of available sessions.

But you want to prevent new users from starting a new session of the old version. Therefore, the old version of the tool needs to be marked as “obsolete”. This will prevent it from being displayed in the list of available tools in the OiRA client (under “Start a new session”).

.. figure:: images/editor/client_list_of_tools.png
    :align: center
    :height: 300px
    :alt: List of available tools shown to the user

    *List of available tools shown to the user*

To achieve this, edit the OiRA tool in the CMS and tick the check-box “Obsolete OiRA tool”. The OiRA tool then needs to be published again for this change to become active.

.. figure:: images/editor/editor_obsolete_tool.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Marking an OiRA tool as obsolete

    *Marking an OiRA tool as obsolete*


Inform existing users that a new version available
--------------------------------------------------

Even though existing users of the old version might be content to just access their answers and the reports under the old URL, they might benefit from the new version of the OiRA tool. This might be relevant for example when the OiRA tool was adapted to a changed legislation.

Apart from communication channels outside of the OiRA application (e.g. the OiRA website, the website of your organization, newsletters, etc.), you can also place a message directly inside OiRA that gets shown to users who access the old version.

See the :ref:`section about adding a custom notification <custom-notification>` on how to achieve this.


-------------------
Unpublishing a tool
-------------------

A tool can be unpublished. Unpublishing makes a tool unavailable in the OiRA client. Any saved sessions will be retained and can be accessed again if you re-publish the tool later.

You do not need to unpublish a tool to make modifications.
